We develop confidence sets which provide spatial uncertainty guarantees for the output of a black-box machine learning model designed for image segmentation. To do so we adapt conformal inference to the imaging setting, obtaining thresholds on a calibration dataset based on the distribution of the maximum of the transformed logit scores within and outside of the ground truth masks. We prove that these confidence sets, when applied to new predictions of the model, are guaranteed to contain the true unknown segmented mask with desired probability. We show that learning appropriate score transformations on an \nt{independent} learning dataset before performing calibration is crucial for optimizing performance. \nt{We illustrate and validate our approach on polyps colonscopy, brain imaging datasets and teeth datasets. To do so we obtain the logit scores from deep neural networks trained for polyps, brain mask and tooth segmentation segmentation. We show that using using distance and other transformations of the logit scores allows us to provide tight inner and outer confidence sets for the true masks whilst controlling the false coverage rate.}
