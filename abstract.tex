We develop confidence sets which provide spatial uncertainty guarantees for the output of a black-box machine learning model designed for image segmentation. To do so we adapt conformal inference to the imaging setting, learning thresholds  on a calibration dataset based on the distribution of the maximum of the logit scores, provided by the model, within and outside of the ground truth masks. We show that these sets, when applied to new predictions of the model, are guaranteed to contain the true unknown segmented mask with desired probability. We illustrate and validate our approach, to show that it has the desired coverage rate, on a range of biomedical imaging applications. These include polyp detection in colonoscopy scans, brain image segmentation, and melanoma identification.
